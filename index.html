                        My name is Sophie Dawn Twilight. But I usually go by Vampy. 
                        I'm a girl who was born on the 1st of January in the year 2000 in England, after which I was abandoned by my biological parents. 
                        I don't really remember much that happened before I was 6 apart from the fact that my name was Katie.
                        My DoB and name were figured out using pieces of a ripped up birth certificate that was abandoned with me. 
                        I was adopted when I was 6 which was when my name became Sophie Twilight. 
                        I got my middle name when I was 10.
                        I'm 5'0 tall, or 153cm tall in normal units, which is both convenient and inconvenient at times. 
                        I'm Demi-Bi, which basically means I will only be attrated to people who I have a strong emotional bond with regardless of their gender.

                        <p class="hobby-info_text">I started cooking as a way to try to earn my keep after getting adopted but ended up actually enjoying it a lot. I mostly learned through trial and error and by the time I was 11 I was cooking all the food for my siblings, from breakfast to dinner, 3 meals a day, and the occational snack. And by the time I was 14 I was doing the same for my parents.</p>

In the beginning we played premade campaigns, but after a while our GM started making all the campaigns with the help of one other friend. I usually played a homebrew vampire character, with a class of cleric or fighter. Usually cleric, clerics are broken, I love em.</p>

I didn't do it for any reason other than just wanting to have the skill and show it off. I ended up only showing it off a couple times and now all my friends are used to it so there's no showing off. But I do still do it and use my flexibility for something.</p>

I watched a lot of anime in the beginning, in the first 2 years of watching anime I watched around 300 shows, in the following 2 years it was around 100, and like 100 in the last 2, so it's kinda tapered off since I ran out of stuff to watch. When it comes to manga, I started reading it a bit after I started watching anime to see the source material of a show, and I started expanding it to manga on it's own.</p>

After a while I started reading light novels without anime/manga since I started enjoying rading, and it's one of the main things I did when I ran out of anime to watch. Some of the light novels I read got anime adaptations, so I enjoyed getting to see the stuff I read animated.</p>

But when I wanted to make a css profile for anilist I got the motivation I needed to learn to code. So I started teaching myself to code, and after a while I made multiple css profile versions. And after even more time I wanted to make a full website, not this website, but one which is older. The one you're on now was made by a friend of mine who's a lot better than I am in web development.</p>

As a result, I'm very introverted, I don't really need to interact with other people all that often.</p>

Most of my intuitive side comes from watching fantasy anime and just reading fantasy in general, specifically the isekai genre. So I think I'm close to even on both sides, but I'm more grounded in the present cause I don't expect to live to see a lot of the technology that's in the potential future.</p>

                        <p class="personality-stat_explanation aniShow toTop">My actions generally seem to lean more on my emotions than my rational thinking side. For example me not paying attention in school, or me not fixing my social anxiety, cause I didn't enjoy doing those things, I didn't enjoy school partially due to how I was treated by teachers and other students and partially cause I just didn't enjoy the content. I didn't fix my social anxiety cause I didn't like putting myself in uncomfortable situations in order to do so. However on the other hand there are a lot of things I'm very logical about, such as not celebrating holidays, such as Christmas or my birthday. I don't celebrate them as I don't see a reason to do so, if you're doing it for the purpose of exchanging gifts, then I don't see why you need an excuse of it being a holiday to give someone a gift. The more emotional side of why I don't celebrate holidays is cause I don't like the social pressure of having to give someone a gift on a specific day and also the fact that it is a set date removes the surprise of the gift completely.</p>

                        <p class="personality-stat_explanation aniShow toTop">I'm pretty much even on both sides for this. I don't really plan ahead and I just go with the flow, but the thing is I'm not really good at it, I'm neither good at planning nor dealing with situations in the moment. I tend to be impulsive in my decisions, however I do think about the impulsive decisions. For example, when I learned programming, the decision to learn to program was an impulsive one, however it was something I thought about to see if it would be worth learning, etc.</p>

                        <p class="personality-stat_explanation aniShow toTop">I personally think this one is less me being turbulent and more me being non-assertive. I'm personally very much a side character in my own life. I don't try to better myself for any grand purpose, nor do I feel like I'm characterized by disorder or conflict. I feel like I'm just not very assertive in most situations, I don't like nor feel comfortable taking lead in different situations, nor do I feel like I need to do or be more than other people, I just do however much I need to do and leave it at that. I'm not really confident in myself or my abilities to the point where some people say it comes across as self depricating.</p>
